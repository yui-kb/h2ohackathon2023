# Water and sewage pipe analysis

Our project for the hackathon below:
https://compsoc-nwg.devpost.com

Requires `folium`, `numpy` & `pandas`.

Takes CSV input of positions of water monitors and which they're connected to, along with other information, and then returns an interactive map showing the connections and the likelihood of each pipe failing.
